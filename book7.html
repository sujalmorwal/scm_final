    <h2>The Death of Robin Hood By Angus Donald</h2>
    <p>The plot follows Robin Hood as he becomes an outlaw after a conflict with foresters and 
        through his many adventures and run-ins with the law. Each chapter tells a different tale of 
        Robin as he recruits Merry Men, resists the authorities, and aids his fellow man.
        n this masterly historical novel, Peter Vansittart traces the growth and decline of the central English myth of Robin Hood, who stole from the rich to give to the poor—as well as hugely 
        satisfying as a novel, it is an elegy to a vanished world.</p>

      <h3>John Adams</h3>
    <p>Vansittart's novels are as difficult to review as they are to read, but that is no excuse to avoid this wonderful, evocative novel. Do not 
        expect a plot which is linear and in any sense easy to follow. Do expect descriptive passages which are lush and weave a net of enchantment around the reader. 
        Be prepared to take time to reread, for this is the novel of ideas par excellence, ideas which may only occur long after you have laid the book aside, ideas which may send you back to study again passages which you have passed over at an earlier stage.

      <h3>Leonard A. Caplan</h3>
      <p>An epic ending to a classic tale of a medieval legend. I had recently read a tale of El CID (The Lord of Valencia and 2 others), and 
        
found similarities that worked well in presenting the tales of these historical heroes. Both takes were presented by the best friend and 
comrade of the legendary figures. And both ended as they had to. If you appreciate knights in the warfare of the time, with plenty of 
intrigue, twists and turns , and enduring characters, you will love The Death of Robin Hood. 
        And if you loved these books of Robin Hood by Angus Donald, you will also like the tale of El Cid by Grieff Hosker</p>
