    <h2>Little Women by Louisa May Alcott

        </h2>
    <p>Alcott prefaces Little Women with an excerpt from John Bunyan’s seventeenth-century work The Pilgrim’s Progress, an allegorical 
        novel about leading a Christian life. Alcott’s story begins with the four March girls—Meg, Jo, Beth, and Amy—sitting in 
        their living room, lamenting their poverty. The girls decide that they will each buy themselves a present in order to 
        brighten their Christmas. Soon, however, they change their minds and decide that instead of buying presents for themselves, 
        they will buy presents for their mother, Marmee. Marmee comes home with a letter from Mr. March, the girls’ father, who 
        is serving as a Union chaplain in the Civil War. 
        The letter inspires the girls to bear their burdens more cheerfully and not to complain about their poverty.  </p>

      <h3>Summer Rain</h3>
      <p>At first, diving into this book felt like a slow wade through unfamiliar waters. But as I kept going, the story suddenly 
        grabbed me, pulling me into a current so strong I couldn't put it down. The plot twist hit me out of nowhere – 
        it was brilliant, making me rethink everything I'd read up to that point. Although I was left wanting a more tied-up conclusion, the open ending has me on my toes for a sequel or prequel. 
        This book wasn't just a read; it was an experience, one that left me both challenged and eager for more.</p>
